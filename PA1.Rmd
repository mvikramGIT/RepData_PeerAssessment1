## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
dt <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(dt)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
a <- aggregate(steps ~ date, dt, sum)
hist(a$steps, xlab = "Steps", main = "Histogram of Steps in a day", col = "Red")
     ```

The average steps taken per day is 
```{r} 
mean(a$steps)
``` 
and the median is 
```{r}
median(a$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
a <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, dt, mean)
plot(a$interval, a$steps, type = 'l', xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Mean steps")
```

The interval with maximum average number of steps across days is as follows.
```{r}
a$interval[a$steps == max(a$steps)]
```

## Inputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
